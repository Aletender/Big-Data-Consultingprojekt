    abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The aim of this article is to perform a comparative analysis of the Angular v10 and Vue v3.0 frameworks. The basis of the comparison is the performance tested with two applications that are similar in terms of functionality. The view with a variable number of displayed elements was examined, and the time was measured from the moment the number of components was indicated to the end of rendering. The amount of disk space occupied by the final applications and application segments was also compared in relation to the method of implementing their functionality. The results of the research allowed to formulate the conclusions that Vue is more efficient than Angular and additionally the Vue application takes up less disk space.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

    abstractNote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The aim of the work is to conduct a performance analysis and, on its basis, to indicate the most user-friendly and fastest operating framework. Three Internet applications have been written to test the speed of operation of selected technologies. Some of the most popular frameworks were analyzed: Angular, React and Vue. Static comparative criteria used in the work are: favorable and generally available documentation, application development, speed of application development, development and support by creators. The practical criteria are the times measured during the execution of the tests. The tests were performed with simple operations using the CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) function. The performance analysis carried out in this way shows the differences between the frameworks. The following developerPersian tools were used for the comparative analysis: Google Analytics, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome DevTools.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
